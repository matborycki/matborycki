## About me

Hi everyone! My name is Mateusz and I am 24 year old engineer from Krak√≥w, PL. Although I have a electrical engineering background, I want to become a technical communication expert in the Software documentation area. I've been currently learning Markdown and JavaScript, and I hope to gain some edge on the job market :)
